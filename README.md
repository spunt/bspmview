# **THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED**

- Use at your own risk!
- Always independently verify the accuracy of any output you plan to use (e.g., use native SPM functionality/UI to check the statistical thresholding, automatic tables of local maxima, atlas labels)!
- Good luck and stuff!

### BSPMVIEW
#### MATLAB Program for playing with fMRI statistical maps

Online documentation can be found here: http://www.bobspunt.com/software/bspmview/.

Requires that Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) be in your MATLAB search path. It has only been tested on SPM8/SPM12 operating in MATLAB 2014b. It requires a number of supporting utility functions and data files that should have been included in the distribution of BSPMVIEW. When BSPMVIEW is launched, it will look for these files in a folder called "supportfiles" that should be contained in the same folder as BSPMVIEW. You can use the following DOI to cite use of this software: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/21612/spunt/bspmview.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/21612/spunt/bspmview)

#### OPTIONAL INPUTS
**ol**: filename for statistical image to overlay
**ul**: filename for anatomical image to use as underlay

#### COMMAND LINE USAGE EXAMPLES
<pre><code>
>> bspmview                               % open dialogue for selecting overlay
>> S = bspmview;                          % returns struct 'S' containing GUI obj handles
>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img')              % overlay on default underlay
>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img','T1.nii')     % overlay on 'T1.nii'
</code></pre>

#### CREDITS
This software heavily relies on functions contained within the SPM software, and is essentially an attempt to translate some of it into a simpler and more user-friendly format. In addition, this software was   inspired by and in some cases uses code from two other statistical image viewers: XJVIEW.m by Xu Cui, Jian Li, and Xiaowei Song
(http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview8/developers/), and FIVE.m by Aaron P. Schultz (http://mrtools.mgh.harvard.edu/index.php/Main_Page). This also employs some of the functionality of PEAK_NII.m by Donald McLaren (http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~mclaren/ftp/Utilities_DGM/). Finally, several contributions to the MATLAB File Exchange (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) are called by the code. These are included in the "supporting files" folder that should have been included in the distribution of the main BSPMVIEW function.
